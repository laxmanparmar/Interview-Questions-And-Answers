** What are Constraints in SQL **
```
Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table

Primary Key Constraint:  Ensures that a column (or a group of columns) uniquely identifies each record in a table.
It implies that the column cannot contain NULL values and must have unique values within the table.
eg: StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY

Foreign Key Constraint: Establishes a link between data in two tables,
where the foreign key column in one table refers to the primary key column in another table.
eg: OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID),

Unique Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column (or a group of columns) are unique, except for NULL values
eg:  SSN VARCHAR(11) UNIQUE

Check Constraint: Defines a condition that the data in a column must satisfy. 
eg: Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Quantity INT,
    CHECK (Price > 0 AND Quantity >= 0)

Not Null Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.
eg:     Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL

Default: DEFAULT constraint is used to provide a default value.
    column1 datatype DEFAULT default_value,
```
***

**What is a Join? List its different types**
```
The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two.

There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:
(INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.
