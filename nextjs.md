** 1) What is Next.js, and how is it different from React? **
```
Next.js is a React-based open-source framework that helps developers build server-side rendered React applications.
The key difference between React and Next.js is the way they handle routing. React uses client-side routing,
Next.js provides server-side routing, which means that the server handles the routing and sends the pre-rendered pages to the client, resulting in faster page loads and better SEO.
Next.js also provides additional features like automatic code splitting, static site generation.

** 3) What is server-side rendering, and why is it important? **
```
Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the client's browser.
SSR is important because it allows search engines to crawl and index your website's content, which can improve your website's SEO

** 4) What is client-side rendering, and how does it differ from server-side rendering? **
```
Client-side rendering (CSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the client's browser using JavaScript after receiving the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the server.
CSR sends an empty HTML page that is populated by JavaScript.SSR sends a fully rendered HTML page to the client's browser

** 6) What is static site generation, and how does it differ from server-side rendering? **
```
Static Site Generation: In SSG, the web pages are pre-rendered at build time. This means that the content is generated and HTML files are created before they are served to the client. The generated HTML files are static and do not change for different users.

for eg. we can have pages like about us, contact us , privacy policy as SSG.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR):  In SSR, web pages are generated dynamically on the server in response to a user's request.
SSR can be more resource-intensive because it involves running code on the server for each user request
