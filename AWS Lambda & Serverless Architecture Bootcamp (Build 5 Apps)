Getting Started With Serverless Computing on AWS

Data storage has become very affordable and computing power has vastly increased.
And this has allowed us to build applications that leverage these advancements in the computing
space.
The application has to be fast and responsive. And at the same time, it must be scalable with almost no downtime.

Serverless Computing is this new trend in cloud computing which attempts to solve many
of these challenges.

Now, if we look at the traditional architecture, there are several activities and tasks that
you must perform in order to run any particular application.

First, you got to create and setup servers, install operating systems, install and setup
databases, manage software patches and hardware updates, manage capacity and scaling, Manage
High-availability through load-balancing and so on.
And of course, this server infrastructure and the computing power has its own costs, which
are often substantial.

On the other hand, with Serverless Architecture, all these mundane tasks of managing the underlying
infrastructure are abstracted away from us.
So in a way when you use serverless architecture, you won’t really feel like you are using
any high-end servers, because you’re not the one who is actually taking care of it.

That’s the reason this approach is called as Serverless.

That means, Serverless Computing still uses servers, but you no longer have to worry about
managing them or worry about the uptime or availability or anything that has to do with the infrastructure
part.

Serverless means “Event-driven Computing” using “Small independent stateless
functions” running inside “containers in the cloud”.
That’s the short definition of what Serverless is all about.

Whenever the triggering event occurs, the cloud platform spins up a container or initializes
a container, loads the function in it and executes the function.

These events could be file uploads, database updates, in-app activity, API calls, website
clicks, or sensor outputs just like those from IoT devices and so on.

We'll create a hello world API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
