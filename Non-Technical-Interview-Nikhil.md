eg.
Hello, my name is Nikhil Patil. I have completed my Engineering in Computer Science and have also earned certifications in JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Firebase.
I have 6+ years of experience as a MERN Stack Developer, with strong expertise in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Currently, I am working at ZORO UK as a MERN Stack Developer, where I contribute to building and maintaining a scalable B2B e-commerce platform with features like complex product catalogues, user authentication, and third-party integrations.
Previously, I have worked on projects such as a school management system at NeoSOFT and a hotel and travel booking platform at Vernost, which gave me hands-on experience in developing responsive web applications, RESTful APIs, and scalable front-end solutions.
Apart from my MERN expertise, I am also comfortable working with Redux, Tailwind, Jest, Git, and AWS serverless. I’m passionate about delivering high-quality solutions, learning new technologies, and collaborating with teams to build impactful products.

**What drives you in your career?**
```
What really drives me is the idea that a few lines of code can have such a big impact on people’s lives.
I love the fact that something I build can make someone’s work easier, save their time, or even improve their daily experience.
That feeling of seeing a project go from just an idea to something real that people actually use—that’s what keeps me motivated.
