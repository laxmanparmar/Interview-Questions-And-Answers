eg.
I worked on the restructuring and enhancement of an existing commercial website for a client in the IT industry. 
It is basically a auditing tool for internal usage. The primary goal of the project was to provide a digital platform for the client to evaluate its employees and handle their data by modernizing the website's design and enhancing its performance.
I served as the lead front-end developer. My responsibilities included wireframing, coding the front-end components, and collaborating with the SharePoint database team. I implemented a responsive design to cater to a wider audience.
The technologies used in this project are : React.js, for Frontend and SCSS for styling.
UI/UX Design: Figma for wireframing and design mockups.
Database: SharePoint for storing product data.
Coming to my learnings from this project, I gained improved proficiency in React.js and Gained experience in optimizing frontend performance through code splitting and lazy loading.
Learned to work efficiently in a cross-functional team, collaborating with SharePoint developers and designers.

**What are your strengths and weaknesses?**
```
My strengths are team collaboration and continuous learning
One noteworthy instance of collaboration was when my colleague encountered a problem requiring a difficult feature integration of the front end with the backend. The other sections of the code were impacted by his feature.  I worked with him to help him comprehend other sections of the code so that we could complete his task using that information. That's how we managed to finish the work.
coming to learning.
I'm deeply committed to continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of software development. One way I actively pursue learning opportunities is by participating in online courses.

Weakness:- 
Impatience with Legacy Code
I used to feel impatient when dealing with legacy codebases, but I've realized the importance of maintaining and refactoring them. I've since adopted a more patient and systematic approach to legacy code.
I've found that public speaking is an area where I can improve. I'm taking steps to overcome this by participating in internal presentations to become a more effective communicator.

**What drives you in your career?**
```
What drives me in my career as a software developer is the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful solutions. I find great satisfaction in using my technical skills to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. It's incredibly rewarding to see a project I've worked on come to life and make a difference for users.
```
***
**What has been your most notable achievement so far?**
```
I consider one of my most notable achievements as a software developer to be in a project that was initially abandoned due to technical challenges and resource constraints. The project involved a goal to provide a digital platform to the client to evaluate its employees and handle their data. After the initial setback, I took the initiative to revive and complete it.
```
***
**Could you please let us know about an instance where you demonstrated leadership?**
```
In a previous job, I was part of a software development team working on a complex project with a tight deadline. While I didn't have a formal leadership title, I took the initiative to demonstrate leadership in the following ways:
one of them was when the team encountered technical challenges, I facilitated discussions to identify solutions. I encouraged team members to share their ideas and collaborated with them to find the best way to overcome obstacles
and other was I consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic by meeting deadlines and going the extra mile when necessary. This set a standard for professionalism and dedication that other team members followed.

# This Section is How Do You Work

**How do you preserve the information you obtain (Eg. Requirement from client, expectation from your manager?**
```
As far as protecting the information is concerned, I do not share the information with any one. I always keep my system password protected. For storing the information, I store all the project related information in separate folders on secure servers. I also keep my personal notes in my diary. Additionally, we maintain the updates about progress and timelines on tools like jira. That's how I preserve the information I obtain.
```
***
**How do you report back / update on progress?**
```
I send email to the client stating the update of the project on daily basis and how much time it will take to complete it. Additionally, we also have stand up calls where we discuss the work done, work planned and challenges we face. That's how I report back the progress of the work.
```
***
**How do you prioritize your work?**
```
I make a to-do list at the start of the day and then prioritize it. I keep the tasks that are both urgent and important on top priority, while tasks that are important but not urgent on lower priority. That's how I prioritize my work.
```
***
**How do you deal with pressure at the work place?**
```
I don’t get affected by pressure much. I stay calm and focused. In fact, I work well under pressure. If it gets too much, I take short breaks to unwind. That’s how I deal with pressure. 
```
***
**How do you handle criticism/negative feedback?**
```
I believe that negative feedback is an important part of the learning and growth process. Whenever I get the negative feedback, I acknowledge and accept it and try to improve upon these areas. That's how I handle negative feedback.
```
***
**How do you manage a situation where your co-workers are not working and its affecting your task & overall delivery of the project/sprint?**
```
First of all, I connect with them to understand the reason. If they are stuck or if they are struggling with something, I try and help them. If still they don't work, then I raise this issue to my team lead. I request them to intervene and help resolve the situation. That's how I handle such a situation.
```
***
**Do you feel perfection is more important than meeting the deadline? Explain why.**
```
I think both are important. Imperfect work would lead to rework and eventually more time investment. So, one should strive to complete the project perfectly within the given deadline.
```
***
**How do you ensure that the tasks assigned to you are completed successfully within the stipulated time?**
```
I make sure that I complete the work within the stipulated time by understanding the task correctly, then by breaking down the task into subtasks and prioritizing them. I also assign timelines for each sub task and make sure that they are completed within those timelines. That's how I do it.
```
***

**How do you measure your success (top 3 career metrics)?**
```
As a software engineer, success can be measured in various ways, and the top three career metrics may differ for each individual. However, from my perspective, three metrics are:  
1. Technical Proficiency and Skill Growth: Continuous improvement in technical skills and proficiency is a key measure of success for a software engineer. 
2. Project Impact and Delivery: I often measure my success by the impact I make on projects. Some examples like 
Meeting project deadlines and delivering high-quality software on time.
Reducing the number of bugs or issues in software.
3. Career Growth and Advancement: 
This includes Promotions to more senior roles, such as senior software engineer, lead developer.
Expanding your responsibilities and taking on leadership or mentoring roles.
```

**What are the key skills you need to possess to excel in your current role and how you are currently developing those skills or planning to develop those skills?**
```
Front-end development is constantly evolving. Staying up to date with new technologies, best practices, and design trends is crucial for success. Key skills we need to possess to excel are
Responsive Web Design:  Master responsive design techniques to ensure your websites work well on various devices and screen sizes.
Learning Front-End Frameworks: Gain expertise in one or more front-end frameworks based on industry demand.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure your websites work consistently across different browsers.
User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design: Understand UX principles and be able to work closely with designers to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
```
***

**How do you keep yourself updated with the latest technology stack?**
```
First I read technical blogs related to the tech stack I am working to get an idea which new technology is needed for me to upgrade my skills and then I take advantage of online learning platforms such as Coursera, and Udemy to enroll in courses and tutorials that cover the latest technologies.
