React Storybook Tutorial - 1 - Introduction

Storybook: what & Why ?

Storybook is a development environment and playground for UI components.
It allows you to create components independently and showcase them interactively in an isolated development environment.
This means that Storybook runs outside of your main React application, so you can develop UI components in isolation without having to worry about the business logic.

Benefits of using Storybook:
View the different components that have already been developed as part of the app
See the different props that those developed components accept
Visually showcase those components to your stakeholders for feedback
Change the props on a component and immediately see the changes in the UI without having to move back and forth between the browser and your editor
Get feedback about the accessibility score of the component, like color contrast
Learning Storybook is a valuable skill to have as a React developer, especially if you are working on a team.
